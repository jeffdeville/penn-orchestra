# Demo #
Zack suggested using a VMWare player to create a demo. We would need to do:
## Tasks ##
  1. Download free VMWare player.
  1. Pick our favorite Linux distro from VMWare's appliance selection.
  1. Run that in our player. Install free DB2 in the player. Install Orchestra in the player.
  1. Save the VM image.
  1. Distribute the VM image to people for a no-config way to play with Orchestra.
## Questions ##
  * Can you actually save the VM image using the Player?
    * You might only be able to save the image with a non-free version. VM Studio might be able to do it.
