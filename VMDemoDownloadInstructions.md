# Virtual Machine Demo #

We have created a virtual machine with an Orchestra installation already configured and ready to go. We've tested it with the free [VMWare Player](http://www.vmware.com/products/player/) (Windows, Linux) and the non-free [VMWare Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) (Mac), but it should work with other VMWare products too.


# Instructions #
  1. Install VMWare Player or VMWare Fusion.
  1. Download the virtual machine: [orchestra-demo.zip](https://dbappserv.cis.upenn.edu/orchestra-demo/orchestra-demo.zip) (about 2.5 GB).
  1. Unzip orchestra-demo.zip and open orchestra-demo/orchestra-demo.vmx with your VMWare product.
    * You'll see a warning "This virtual machine may have been moved or copied." - just click on "I copied it".
    * If you see a "VMWare Tools is out of date..." message go ahead and follow those instructions
  1. Log on to the virtual machine:
    * user: _db2inst1_
    * password: _orchestra_
  1. Continue on to the [VM demo instructions](VMDemoInstructions.md).
